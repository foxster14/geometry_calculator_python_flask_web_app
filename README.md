# Geometry Calculator Web

The web version of the Geometry Calculator Tool used in SENG3120 & SENG3110

Use this as sample code for related activities.

## App Prep & Run Steps

*To use this code do the following:*

1. **Pick a location on disk and clone this code into a local repository:**

    > git clone https://github.com/axbjos/geometry_calculator_web.git

    (Alternatively the new GitHub CLI could also be used)

    A new directory will be created:  geometry_calculator_web   "cd" into it.

2. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**

    This is a simple Flask-based Python Web App.  It is advisable to use a Python Virtual Environment to keep this app's dependencies separate from other Python dependencies on the target machine. To create a Virtual Environment do the following from within the geometry_calculator_web directory: 

    Unix OS's:   
    > python3 -m venv venv

    Windows:
    > python -m venv venv

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    Unix OS's:  
    >source venv/bin/activate

    Windows:
    >venv\Scripts\activate.bat

4. **Install App Dependencies Using the Python Package Tool:**

    Rather than using pip to install the required packages, such as Flask, etc., all dependencies are in the requirements.txt file.

    > pip install -r requirements.txt

    In a virtual environment that was create using Python 3, on Unix OS's there no need to use pip3.  You can, but pip also works in this instance.

5. Run the Application:

    > python GeometryCalcWeb.py

    The App should now be running.  Access it via `localhost:5000`

    Running App:

    ![serverisrunning](./readmeimages/serverisrunning.png)


## Python Unit Testing

This repo also contains two sample Unit Tests.  One for the cylinder.py module.  One for the GeometryCalcWeb.py program.  It is up to the student to understand how the Unit Tests work. Reference course resources, notes taken in class, instructor demo's.

Run them by doing the following:

> python cylinderTest.py

> python GeometryCalcWeb.py
